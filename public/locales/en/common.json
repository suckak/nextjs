    "lorem": "At times, Low seem to tack back toward the tight songcraft of an album like 2005’s The Great Destroyer, directing HEY WHAT’s strange vocabulary toward the same visceral ends that they once reached with power chords and cymbal crashes. But the story isn’t so simple. HEY WHAT also maintains and deepens Double Negative’s exploration of sustained ambience, with long stretches devoted to the repetition of a single word, or the slow decay of a keyboard line. Even moments like these are not exactly unprecedented for Low, who were already including passages of quietly hypnotic instrumental churn on their debut. Low’s new idiom may have seemed like an aberration on Double Negative, but HEY WHAT’s refinements make it clear that they are still finding fresh angles on the same themes that have animated them since the beginning: using minimalism to express the entwined pairing of intimacy and loneliness, searching for meaning in the rubble after a departure too catastrophic to address by name."
